## Using this project

  >  This project is tested for compatibility with AAP2 Linux Automation Workshop available to Red Hat Employees and Partners.

1. First you must create a credential for [Automation Hub](https://console.redhat.com/ansible/automation-hub/) to successfully sync collections used by this project.
   
   1. In the Credentials section of the Controller UI, add a new Credential called `Automation Hub` with the type `Ansible Galaxy/Automation Hub API Token`
   2. You can obtain a token [here](https://console.redhat.com/ansible/automation-hub/token). This page will also provide the Server URL and Auth Server URL.
   3. Next, click on Organizations and edit the `Default` organization. Add your `Automation Hub` credential to the `Galaxy Credentials` section. Don't forget to click Save!!

2. If it has not been created for you, add a Project called `Ansible official demo project` with this repo as a source. NOTE: if you are using a fork, be sure that you have the correct URL. Update the project.
3. Finally, Create a Job Template called `Setup` with the following configuration:
  
     - Name: Setup
     - Inventory: Workshop Inventory
     - Exec Env: Control Plane EE
     - Playbook: setup_demo.yml
     - Credentials:

        - Type: Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform
        - Name: Controller Credential
     - Extra vars:
  
            demo: <linux or windows>

4. If you require a Windows Active Directory domain you will need to run the "ACTIVE DIRECTORY / Create Active Directory domain" template after the Windows setup completes. This will create the "ansible.local" domain as well as a few generic users and groups.
